">Confusing Statistic Cases</h1>
    <p>Statistics are supposed to make something easier to understand but when used in a misleading fashion can trick the casual observer into believing something other than what the data shows. That is, a misuse of statistics occurs when a statistical argument asserts a falsehood. In some cases, the misuse may be accidental. In others, it is purposeful and for the gain of the perpetrator. When the statistical reason involved is false or misapplied, this constitutes a statistical fallacy.<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-asterisk"></i>

               <p>1. Confusing correlation with causation

A correlation is when two variables vary together, whereas causation occurs when one factor causes the other. It may be tempting to think that the former implies the latter, but that is hardly ever the case. For instance, ice cream sales may increase in the summer and decrease in the winter. The same may be true for drowning accidents. Does this mean we can draw the conclusion that drowning accidents causing ice cream sales? Does this mean that people have become so selfish and morally vile that they prefer to buy ice cream and watching people drown than trying to save them!? Fortunately, not really. Just because two variables vary together does not mean that one caused the other. It might be that the other caused the first, that they both cause each other or that a third factor causes both. In the case of ice cream sales and drowning accidents, a third factor that probably explain the correlation is season. In the summer, more people eat ice cream and go bathing, but fewer to these things in the winter. Confusing correlation with causation is widespread in many areas of pseudoscience, such as the anti-vaccination movement; one of their claims is that as the number of vaccines given have increased, so has the rates of cancer. This shows that the two factors correlate, not that vaccines caused cancer (in fact, the vaccine against HPV and Hepatitis B can prevent cancers) is a correlation, not a causation. A more likely factor is better healthcare as a third factor; better healthcare has meant more vaccines, but also increased lifespan, which is associated with an increase in the risk of cancer

               <p>2. Post hoc

Post hoc and denotes the fallacy of thinking that A causes B just because B follows A in time. This fallacy, like the fallacy of confusing correlation with causation, is understandable from an evolutionary perspective. Those that where too skeptical of attributing an upset stomach to poisonous berries where less likely to reproduce. However, this kind of instinct-based reasoning can no longer be thought of as justified in our modern society. A clear example of this fallacy is thinking that because dawn occurs after the rooster crows, therefore the rooster caused dawn to occur. This fallacy is pretty much a core feature of anti-vaccination rhetoric.

               <p>3. Thinking that the average says anything about the spread

This fallacy can often by found in racist or anti-immigration rhetoric. It is the fallacy of claiming that the average (say, intelligence or prevalence of crime) is different a particular group A compared with another group B, therefore, it is reasonable to treat individuals in group A as if they, say, had lower intelligence or higher prevalence of crime. This is an erroneous argument, because the average says nothing about the spread, that is, how different individuals in the group are distributed. When it comes to IQ scores, a group A in which individuals all have precisely 120 IQ will have a higher average IQ than a group B in which half of the individuals have 95 IQ and the other half 140 IQ (0.5*95+0.5*140 = 117.5), yet clearly half of the individuals in group B have a much higher IQ than individuals in group A, despite the fact that group B containing individuals with a lower IQ than individuals in group A. This could feed into a stereotype of thinking that individuals in group B have less IQ than those in A. These groups and figures are just made up for the purpose of a simple explanation and does not refer to any actually existing group.</p>
